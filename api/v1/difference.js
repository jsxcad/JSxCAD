/**
 *
 * # Difference
 *
 * Difference produces a version of the first shape with the remaining shapes removed, where applicable.
 * Different kinds of shapes do not interact. e.g., you cannot subtract a surface from a solid.
 *
 * ::: illustration { "view": { "position": [40, 40, 40] } }
 * ```
 * difference(Cube(10).below(),
 *            Cube(5).below())
 * ```
 * :::
 * ::: illustration
 * ```
 * difference(Circle(10),
 *            Circle(2.5))
 * ```
 * :::
 * ::: illustration { "view": { "position": [5, 5, 5] } }
 * ```
 * difference(assemble(Cube().below(),
 *                     Cube().above()),
 *            Cube().right())
