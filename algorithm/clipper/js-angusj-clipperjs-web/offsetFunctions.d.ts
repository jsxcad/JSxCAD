   * Firstly, this field/property is only relevant when JoinType = Round and/or EndType = Round.
   *
   * Since flattened paths can never perfectly represent arcs, this field/property specifies a maximum acceptable imprecision ('tolerance') when arcs are
   * approximated in an offsetting operation. Smaller values will increase 'smoothness' up to a point though at a cost of performance and in creating more
   * vertices to construct the arc.
   *
   * The default ArcTolerance is 0.25 units. This means that the maximum distance the flattened path will deviate from the 'true' arc will be no more
   * than 0.25 units (before rounding).
   *
   * Reducing tolerances below 0.25 will not improve smoothness since vertex coordinates will still be rounded to integer values. The only way to achieve
   * sub-integer precision is through coordinate scaling before and after offsetting (see example below).
   *
   * It's important to make ArcTolerance a sensible fraction of the offset delta (arc radius). Large tolerances relative to the offset delta will produce
   * poor arc approximations but, just as importantly, very small tolerances will substantially slow offsetting performance while providing unnecessary
   * degrees of precision. This is most likely to be an issue when offsetting polygons whose coordinates have been scaled to preserve floating point precision.
   *
   * Example: Imagine a set of polygons (defined in floating point coordinates) that is to be offset by 10 units using round joins, and the solution is to
   * retain floating point precision up to at least 6 decimal places.
   * To preserve this degree of floating point precision, and given that Clipper and ClipperOffset both operate on integer coordinates, the polygon
   * coordinates will be scaled up by 108 (and rounded to integers) prior to offsetting. Both offset delta and ArcTolerance will also need to be scaled
   * by this same factor. If ArcTolerance was left unscaled at the default 0.25 units, every arc in the solution would contain a fraction of 44 THOUSAND
   * vertices while the final arc imprecision would be 0.25 × 10-8 units (ie once scaling was reversed). However, if 0.1 units was an acceptable imprecision
   * in the final unscaled solution, then ArcTolerance should be set to 0.1 × scaling_factor (0.1 × 108 ). Now if scaling is applied equally to both
   * ArcTolerance and to Delta Offset, then in this example the number of vertices (steps) defining each arc would be a fraction of 23.
   *
   * The formula for the number of steps in a full circular arc is ... Pi / acos(1 - arc_tolerance / abs(delta))

   * The default value for MiterLimit is 2 (ie twice delta). This is also the smallest MiterLimit that's allowed. If mitering was unrestricted (ie without
