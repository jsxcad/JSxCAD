## JSxCAD

## Unstable - DO NOT USE
(... unless you read the following carefully ...)

This fork of OpenJSCAD is in early development - many things are broken.

It is suitable for use for testing and development until the jscad user API is up to spec.

At this time we are actively seeking representative jscad examples to drive user API development.

If you have example code that you would like to work under JSxCAD please make a PR to add the code under example/v1.

## Overview

This library supports solid modeling (e.g., for 3d printing), surface modeling, and path modeling (e.g, for laser cutting and embroidery).

## Installation

```
npm install @jsxcad/api-v1
```

Note: npm packages will be published once the user api is up to spec.

## Usage

- Running locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/jsxcad/JSxCAD
cd JSxCAD
npm install
cd example/v1
node -r esm run square.js
```

should produce /tmp/square.pdf.

- To build and run a local copy of the website for testing:

```
cd JSxCAD/app/v1
npm run wepback
http-server ./dist -o
```

should produce a new browser tab running a locally hosted version of the webpage for testing
